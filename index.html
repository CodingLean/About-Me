      <h3>All about ME!</h3>
      <p id="Bio">Hello and welcome homies! My name is Isaiah Mitchell , an Ex Drone pilot and Us Army Veteran. In my free time I enjoy blindly throwing my kids around my house and syncronize swimming out with naked Dolphins. I also am going to be a Software Engineer for Nike. I have 7 brothers 3 sisters. I played basketball, boxing and basketball. Fun fact, I code on my freetime and study Nikes prereqs so i know whats going to happen when they hire the best person for the job. Me.</p>
